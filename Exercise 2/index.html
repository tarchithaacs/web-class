        <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Ten Principles for Good Design</h1> <h2 style="text-align:center;"> By Dieter Rams </h2>
        
        <h4> Good Design is Innovative </h4>
        <p>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Good Design Makes a Product Useful</h4>

        <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Good Design is Aesthetic</h4>

        <p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
        
        <h4>Good Design Makes a Product Understandable</h4>
        <p><img src="/Users/tarchithaa/Desktop/fordham/Web Design/Exercise 2/Images/Pouring Mortar and Pestle.jpg" alt="Mortar and Pestle with slight pincg at one corner for easier pouring." height="400px"> </p>
        <p>It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.</p>
        
        <h4>Good Design is Unobtrusive</h4>
        <p>Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user's self-expression.</p>
        
        <h4>Good Design is Honest</h4>
        <p>It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.</p>
       
        <h4>Good Design is Long-lasting</h4>
        <p><img src="/Users/tarchithaa/Desktop/fordham/Web Design/Exercise 2/Images/ceramic handheld mug.jpg" alt="Yellow ceramic mug with speckled eggwhite bottom with a handle" height="400px"> </p>
        <p>It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's throwaway society.</p>
        
        <h4>Good Design is Thorough Down to the Last Detail</h4>
        <p><img src="/Users/tarchithaa/Desktop/fordham/Web Design/Exercise 2/Images/Gripware HighSided Dish.png" alt="A dish with a lowered side for people who may have hand-stability struggles." height="400px"> </p>
        <p>Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.</p>
        
        <h4>Good Design is Environmentally-friendly</h4>
        <p>Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.</p>

        <h4>Good Design is as Little Design as Possible</h4>
        <p><img src="/Users/tarchithaa/Desktop/fordham/Web Design/Exercise 2/Images/ceramic grater.jpg" alt="Ceramic plate with little sharp points at the top" height="400px"> </p>
        <p>Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.</p>
